--------
Progress:
During sprint 2 I was able to establish a broader research question which focuses on the influence of technology/social media on mental health and user habits. In addition datasets were cleaned with any necessary filtering and the initial round of exploratary data analysis focusing on the initial research question was conducted with visualizations included. The following steps will focus on relationships between variables and expanding to make use of more of the data in the datasets which will help anwser the updated research question.
